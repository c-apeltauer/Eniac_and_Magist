## Languages and Libraries Used
SQL
Tableau

## Key Learnings

We used SQL to retrieve relevant data from the database (DB) and used Tableau to create plots and maps, first to explore the data and then to create graphics that will convey our findings in an easily to understand manner.

## Challenges Overcame

DBs are not always are well documented as you wish, but looking into them you can expand your understanding of the data step by step.
You cannot always create the plot you have in mind on the screen, but with a little bit of flexibility you can create other plots that are carrying your message.
